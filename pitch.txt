#Problem
For Fine Art artists, the transition to online has been difficult. Upkeep to create your own ecommerce website is expensive and time-consuming, while having your work featured on a website like Etsy or Amazon results in being one of tens of thousands of artists and is difficult for users to even find your work. For consumers, finding unique art from individual artists online is overwhelming and time consuming. There is no platform that provides a curated experience.
